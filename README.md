# Binary Search Tree (BST) Traversal Routines

## Trees

- [ ] Introduce **graphs** briefly and **tree** as a special case of a **graph** data structure.
- [ ] Add some figures for **graphs** and figures for **trees**.

[*Paragraph here*]

## Binary Search Trees

- [ ] Binary Trees as a special case of Trees.
- [ ] Binary Search Tree (BST) as a special case of Binary Trees
- [X] Add a an example figures for a Binary Tree
- [ ] Add a an example figures for a BST

[*At least two paragraphs here*]

### Motivation

- [ ] Why using BST
- [ ] BST vs. Arrays
- [ ] BST vs. Linked Lists

[*Motivation paragraph here*]

### Node Structure

- [ ] Propose a c++ `struct` of a BST node.

```c++
struct BSTNode
{
// Add memebers here
};
```

### Basic Operations on BST

#### Insertion

- [ ] Description
- [ ] Sample code (Maybe Psuedo)
- [ ] Performance analysis (i.e big-`O` notation)

[*Write here*]

#### Removal

- [ ] Description
- [ ] Sample code (Maybe Psuedo)
- [ ] Performance analysis (i.e big-`O` notation)

[*Write here*]

#### Traversal

- [ ] Description
- [ ] Why traversing a tree (applications)
- [ ] Extra: After writing the next subsections add a comparison table between the 4 traversal routines.

[*Write here*]

##### In-order

- [ ] Description
- [ ] Implement the logic without using recursion (You may use Psuedo-code)
- [ ] Performance analysis (i.e big-`O` notation)

[*Write here*]

##### Pre-order

- [ ] Description
- [ ] Implement the logic without using recursion (You may use Psuedo-code)
- [ ] Performance analysis (i.e big-`O` notation)

[*Write here*]

##### Post-order

- [ ] Description
- [ ] Implement the logic without using recursion (You may use Psuedo-code)
- [ ] Performance analysis (i.e big-`O` notation)

[*Write here*]

##### Breadth-first

- [ ] Description
- [ ] Implement the logic without using recursion (You may use Psuedo-code)
- [ ] Performance analysis (i.e big-`O` notation)
